# Project Overview
## Project Introduction

Lightweight fine-tuning is one of the most important techniques for adapting foundation models because it allows modification of foundation models for specific needs without requiring substantial computational resources.

This project will apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the Hugging Face peft library.

## Project Summary

The project will bring together all essential components of a PyTorch + Hugging Face training and inference process. Specifically, they will:

- Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
- Perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the pre-trained model
- Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
